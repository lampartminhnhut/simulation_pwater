<p>Information (shortened as info) is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind.</br>
It is also that from which data and knowledge can be derived, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts.[1]</br>
As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.</p>

<p>At its most fundamental, information is any propagation of cause and effect within a system.</br>
Information is conveyed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation of some thing.</br>
That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.</p>
