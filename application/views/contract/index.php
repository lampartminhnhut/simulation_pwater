<p>In order for a contract to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called a meeting of the minds).</p>

<p>This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the "mirror image rule".</p>

<p>If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer.</p>

<p>The Uniform Commercial Code disposes of the mirror image rule in ยง2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA</p>
